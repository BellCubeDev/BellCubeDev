# __BellCube Dev__
I'm BellCube, an internet gamer and programmer-by-hobby. Programming is my passion, and logic is my aproach.

# Current Projects
- [Additional Clockwork (Skyrim SE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47087)
- [X] Unreleased Minecraft datapack. Waiting for its debeut on a livestream...
- [X] Another unreleased Minecraft datapack, to be released after the previous one

# About me...
* I use Windows for life. Linux is too much, and Mac is too little (Heavens forbid Chrome OS!).
* I am a security freak. I own a physical USB security key.
* Macros are nice. I have a Logitech G mouse.

### (Current) Favorite Games
* Minecraft (both modded and vanilla)
* Skyrim (modded)
* Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (console)
