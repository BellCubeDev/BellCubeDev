Howdy! I'm BellCube. I mostly make stuff that I'm mad doesn't exist yet.

Programmer by hobby. Thinker by nature[^1].

Many of my projects are browser-based. The browsable internet is incredibly useful, accessible, cross-platform, safe, and easy to use. Even though many of my passion projects would do well as a desktop application, I find the benefits of the web platform outweigh the traditional objections of the "right platform" being desktop applications.

I have a passion for exposing existing information in new ways—especially if those new ways are easier to use. This can be seen most in my [Papyrus Index](https://papyrus.bellcube.dev) project. The Papyrus Index extracts information and documentation about the Papyrus language from many different, disconnected locations and makes it all available in a unique, interlinked, searchable interface.

I have an eye for bugs, which intersects with my perfectionism to create higher-quality work at a slightly slower pace.

## **Unrelated Things About me**

### On Security

I store my passwords in a password manager locked behind a physical security key. I create a unique, lengthy password for each service with little pattern to it (not even common patterns for randomly-generated passwords).

Passkeys are not the future. Passkeys are the present that we refuse to ignore. Please, in your next service, work toward using Passkeys as your first-class authentication method.

#### First-Class Passkey Authentication

The goal is to always use passkeys when possible. The model is not complicated. The user must always use a passkey to log in. Passkeys may be created on a new device by creating a "passkey request". Requests must be approved by submitting a new authentication payload from an existing passkey. The acceptance flow includes a big warning modal, a geolocation display, and an authentication payload. The rejection flow is the click of a button.


Now, the user *does* choose an easy-to-remember password (not necessarily a secure password) at signup, but this password is only entered when requesting a new passkey (to reduce spam). Pending passkey requests should **never** trigger push notifications. Pending requests should never have attention brought to them in any way. Passkey requests should have to be actively sought out by the user. This all but prevents auth spam and similar techniques. Users only need to do this once per device, so it's not a big ask to have them click a few buttons to set a new device up. Be sure to guide them through it on the login page so they don't have to look it up.

### Opinions On Desktop/Laptop Operating Systems

- Windows is a great middle-ground for most people with complex work to do—but has, as of late, thrown consumers, their safety, and their privacy to the wayside in search of investor capital. This must end.
- MacOS is too limited to justify the price. If you're a mobile app developer or a filmmaker looking to use ProRes, you don't have too many choices, though.
- ChromeOS is great for most people, who don't do much more than use their phone and a web browser.
- Linux is where the fun begins. Fully open to the user—ready out the box to be hacked into and mare your own. Respects you as the user. Gives you control. Treats you like you're competent. Speedy, safe, and reliable. My beloved. Oh, and did I mention that it's the only operating system with a sane, centralized update system?

Choose what suits you, but I implore you to consider Tux, Linux's mascot, as your suit of choice :penguin::heart:
